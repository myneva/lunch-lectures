# Shell Scripts Matter

## About

The shell is an odd beast. Although it goes against every current trend in software engineering (strong typing, compile checks over runtime checks, ...), shell scripts are here to stay, and still constitute an important part of every developer's life.

The weird thing about shell scripts is that even strong advocates of good practices gladly forget all they know when it comes to shell scripting.

- **Versioning?** Why bother, it's disposable code.
- **Code quality?** That's just a shell script, it's garbage anyway.
- **Testing?** Nah. There aren't any decent tools for that.

Wrong, wrong, and wrong. Shell scripts have value. Everything you do for real code should be done for non trivial shell scripts, even for a one-time script. That includes versioning, code reviews, continuous integration, static code analysis, and testing.

We will touch everything that can, and should be done when writing shell scripts.
